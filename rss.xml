            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 20</h1><p>Ben has been around since I first attempted to make a full time living at photography. We were roommates together in Denver, and I will never forget the adventures we had. Both of us moved out there on a whim without really knowing each other, and it is a season of my life that has really shaped me into who I am today, both creatively and personally. We have seen each other at our best and worse, been on awkward double dates together, and both tried out for Ninja warrior together... (seriously, scroll back through my facebook videos!)</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ceda77a2-c3fb-4ae2-838b-3e8791527dcb.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 19</h1><p>Super thankful for my friendship with guy. He is a top notch photographer, and I love all of our conversations. It's great to have someone to be vulnerable with, and to challenge each other. I've also photographed all of the portraits from this series in his studio. Thanks Shane!</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/50201f0e-502d-47dc-a403-80f6a3b1e446.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 18</h1><p>Seeing as today is Mother's Day, I had to include my mom in this project. She has supported me through every crazy idea I have had... from my long haired, punk rock guitar days, to dropping out of college to travel across the country, to starting my own business and getting married, she has been believed in me the whole time. Thanks mom! Much love, and I wouldn't be who I am without you.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c3e66295-73d6-42f2-80b2-d639ab99fe20.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 17</h1><p>I’ve added a new assistant to the SLP team, and thought I would intro him via the 52 Portraits project... Everyone, meet Jack! He is headed to film school in the fall, but will be working with me in the mean time. He's been a huge help so far, and its nice having another trust worth set of hands around when things get hectic.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cfac7c2d-fb18-498e-be0a-5c1448b7b933.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 16</h1><p>Tim, pre hair cut. Someone once told him he could be a Hollister model... or so he says. Sorry for the late posting.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 15</h1><p>Of course I would include my dog in this project (Not sure how he beat my wife!). He's a pretty good dude, and got a weeks worth of snacks to make this picture happen. Thanks for not peeing on the seamless paper buddy.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7522d8fc-1742-4de2-b4a5-360647644acc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 14</h1><p>Ruthie, the other half of 22|44. She didn't know she was going to get her photo taken until about 30 seconds before it happened... but I guess thats what happens when you show up to a studio.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6fd3a8bc-da59-4606-9775-a53097efc5c8.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 13</h1><p>Brittany is literally always smiling, and its pretty infectious. She's a great producer, and when things get chaotic, you can always count on her to be positive and keeping things moving forward. Aside from being an awesome producer, she has created her own fashion line called 22|44 you should check out. Thanks for being part of the project Brit!</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cd6f472c-b0c6-475e-a323-38cbb488fce2.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 12</h1><p>John is the owner and biologist behind Alluvian, a skin care company that makes its products largely from ocean based ingredients like seaweed, salts, and other minerals. He is currently in the process of building a new site and asked me to do some photography for it - ranging from product/still life sets to some lifestyle and portrait scenes. I love working with people that believe in and are passionate about what they are doing, and John is no exception. After we got done shooting last week, I asked if he would mind lathering up in front of the camera with some of his shave cream for a portrait.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/831c558a-9aae-4afa-a6f7-17b102aea709.jpg"></article>]]></description>
