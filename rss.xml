            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 7</h1><p>I met Collin when he asked me if he could purchase a print from myWyomingseries. He plays in a relatively popular band from the area, so I knew who he was, but we had never talked before. I loved his dreads, and asked if he would be up for letting me take his portrait when he picked up the print. He's actually lounging sideways in a chair for this photo. Its been interesting learning how to adapt situations to best suit a subject while still accomplishing the end goal and keeping the images consistent with the project. Thanks Collin!</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b0004af3-b6b9-4eb2-b7e7-87cbd5a178a5.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 6</h1><p>I admire John immensely. There are few people on this earth who selflessly care about others at the capacity that he does. He is in amazing leader, father, grandfather, mentor, and pastor, that always has a newfound energy and passion for every person he meets or talks with. Thanks for letting me photograph you!</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0b86e43a-ad16-4040-9e87-9e259e03246f.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 5</h1><p>My friends daughter 'Fluff' has had big hair as long as I have known her. Ive always thought it would be fun to shoot a portrait of her, framed by her own hair, and this project gave me the perfect reason to.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/101b02ba-4f7b-436e-a322-cfd1f754e1a4.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 2</h1><p>For my second portrait of this series, I thought my friend Lizzy would be great a subject. She had never been photographed in a studio situation before, so it was fun to direct her and work together to get an image we both really liked. We shot for about 15 minutes, and ended up with the image below that I really loved. Thanks Lizzy!</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b367ed83-15af-448e-b5d9-5e8eec05ea2d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[52 Portraits, No. 1]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 1</h1><p>A few years ago I did a photo 365 project, and was really amazed at how much I grew through the project, as well as how much fun I had. I love shooting portraits, but most of my work and personal projects have always been location assignments where I am lighting people in natural backgrounds. As much fun as those are, I want to push myself to shoot more portraits in the studio on a background. Its a different way and challenge to capturing someone and tell a story. For the rest of the year I'll be shooting a black and white portrait of someone every week, and sharing on my blog and instagram. I couldn't think of a better person to start off with than my good friend Austin, who is actually moving out west this weekend. Can't wait to see the collection of images as a whole one year from now, or who I will meet and photograph through it.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7ea77e03-6f21-47cc-9ae8-62fd445c6798.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 4</h1><p>Mike has become such a good friend and mentor to me over the past couple of years, so I knew I needed to photograph him for this project. I don't think I know anyone who can simultaneously work so hard while also leading an awesome family the way that he does. If man cards were a real thing, your face would probably be on them Mike.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8d76d79e-1056-4271-8a38-3a38cbe8e3ed.jpg"></article>]]></description>
