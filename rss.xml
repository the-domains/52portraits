            <title><![CDATA[52 Portraits, No. 1]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 1</h1><p>A few years ago I did a photo 365 project, and was really amazed at how much I grew through the project, as well as how much fun I had. I love shooting portraits, but most of my work and personal projects have always been location assignments where I am lighting people in natural backgrounds. As much fun as those are, I want to push myself to shoot more portraits in the studio on a background. Its a different way and challenge to capturing someone and tell a story. For the rest of the year I'll be shooting a black and white portrait of someone every week, and sharing on my blog and instagram. I couldn't think of a better person to start off with than my good friend Austin, who is actually moving out west this weekend. Can't wait to see the collection of images as a whole one year from now, or who I will meet and photograph through it.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7ea77e03-6f21-47cc-9ae8-62fd445c6798.jpg"></article>]]></description>
