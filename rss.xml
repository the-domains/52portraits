            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 18</h1><p>Seeing as today is Mother's Day, I had to include my mom in this project. She has supported me through every crazy idea I have had... from my long haired, punk rock guitar days, to dropping out of college to travel across the country, to starting my own business and getting married, she has been believed in me the whole time. Thanks mom! Much love, and I wouldn't be who I am without you.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c3e66295-73d6-42f2-80b2-d639ab99fe20.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 17</h1><p>I’ve added a new assistant to the SLP team, and thought I would intro him via the 52 Portraits project... Everyone, meet Jack! He is headed to film school in the fall, but will be working with me in the mean time. He's been a huge help so far, and its nice having another trust worth set of hands around when things get hectic.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cfac7c2d-fb18-498e-be0a-5c1448b7b933.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 16</h1><p>Tim, pre hair cut. Someone once told him he could be a Hollister model... or so he says. Sorry for the late posting. Its been a pretty hectic couple of weeks, and just realized I hadn’t been posting these!</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2971efcb-52ed-4179-b0a3-c5063dc11d87.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 15</h1><p>Of course I would include my dog in this project (Not sure how he beat my wife!). He's a pretty good dude, and got a weeks worth of snacks to make this picture happen. Thanks for not peeing on the seamless paper buddy.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7522d8fc-1742-4de2-b4a5-360647644acc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 14</h1><p>Ruthie, the other half of 22|44. She didn't know she was going to get her photo taken until about 30 seconds before it happened... but I guess thats what happens when you show up to a studio.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6fd3a8bc-da59-4606-9775-a53097efc5c8.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 13</h1><p>Brittany is literally always smiling, and its pretty infectious. She's a great producer, and when things get chaotic, you can always count on her to be positive and keeping things moving forward. Aside from being an awesome producer, she has created her own fashion line called 22|44 you should check out. Thanks for being part of the project Brit!</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cd6f472c-b0c6-475e-a323-38cbb488fce2.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[52 Portraits, No. 12]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 12</h1><p>John is the owner and biologist behind Alluvian, a skin care company that makes its products largely from ocean based ingredients like seaweed, salts, and other minerals. He is currently in the process of building a new site and asked me to do some photography for it - ranging from product/still life sets to some lifestyle and portrait scenes. I love working with people that believe in and are passionate about what they are doing, and John is no exception. After we got done shooting last week, I asked if he would mind lathering up in front of the camera with some of his shave cream for a portrait.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/831c558a-9aae-4afa-a6f7-17b102aea709.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[52 Portraits, No. 11]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 11</h1><p>My Uncle Ned is this weeks subject for the 52 Portraits project. We spent a lot of family get togethers jamming in his basement on one of the coolest guitar collections you could imagine. A couple of years ago he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease. Instead of letting it define his future in a negative way, he has decided to use it as a tool to both strengthen others with Parkinson's, and educate people on the topic. A series of events led him to join a program called Rock Steady Boxing, where boxing is used a tool to literally fight back against Parkinson’s. You can read more about the boxing program, and my Uncle’s storyhere.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9046cab6-26e4-4e51-b2d7-1ee0696b4692.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 10</h1><p>My friend Ty - coffee connoisseur, people lover, all around great guy. Ty is also an owner of 3030 Coffee (like Dan below). As I have observed him working over the past few years, I am always impressed by the respect, dignity, and positive attitude he shows every customer who walks in his store. Thanks for being part of the series man!</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f8b9e862-605d-44aa-93e9-13d9e7d2096d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No 9</h1><p>Dan is a co owner of my favorite coffee shops, and over the past several years of going there on a near daily basis, we have become pretty good friends. Dan has always had a pretty cool beard or mustache combination, so I thought it would be fun to include him in the project. We shared a couple beers, chatted about our favorite taco places, and came out with this image.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4483d39d-6f8f-430c-981e-852b888657d0.jpg"></article>]]></description>
