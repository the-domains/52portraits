            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 13</h1><p>Brittany is literally always smiling, and its pretty infectious. She's a great producer, and when things get chaotic, you can always count on her to be positive and keeping things moving forward. Aside from being an awesome producer, she has created her own fashion line called 22|44 you should check out. Thanks for being part of the project Brit!</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cd6f472c-b0c6-475e-a323-38cbb488fce2.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 12</h1><p>John is the owner and biologist behind Alluvian, a skin care company that makes its products largely from ocean based ingredients like seaweed, salts, and other minerals. He is currently in the process of building a new site and asked me to do some photography for it - ranging from product/still life sets to some lifestyle and portrait scenes. I love working with people that believe in and are passionate about what they are doing, and John is no exception. After we got done shooting last week, I asked if he would mind lathering up in front of the camera with some of his shave cream for a portrait.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/831c558a-9aae-4afa-a6f7-17b102aea709.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[52 Portraits, No. 11]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 11</h1><p>My Uncle Ned is this weeks subject for the 52 Portraits project. We spent a lot of family get togethers jamming in his basement on one of the coolest guitar collections you could imagine. A couple of years ago he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease. Instead of letting it define his future in a negative way, he has decided to use it as a tool to both strengthen others with Parkinson's, and educate people on the topic. A series of events led him to join a program called Rock Steady Boxing, where boxing is used a tool to literally fight back against Parkinson’s. You can read more about the boxing program, and my Uncle’s storyhere.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9046cab6-26e4-4e51-b2d7-1ee0696b4692.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 10</h1><p>My friend Ty - coffee connoisseur, people lover, all around great guy. Ty is also an owner of 3030 Coffee (like Dan below). As I have observed him working over the past few years, I am always impressed by the respect, dignity, and positive attitude he shows every customer who walks in his store. Thanks for being part of the series man!</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f8b9e862-605d-44aa-93e9-13d9e7d2096d.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No 9</h1><p>Dan is a co owner of my favorite coffee shops, and over the past several years of going there on a near daily basis, we have become pretty good friends. Dan has always had a pretty cool beard or mustache combination, so I thought it would be fun to include him in the project. We shared a couple beers, chatted about our favorite taco places, and came out with this image.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/4483d39d-6f8f-430c-981e-852b888657d0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[52 Portraits, No. 7]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 7</h1><p>I met Collin when he asked me if he could purchase a print from myWyomingseries. He plays in a relatively popular band from the area, so I knew who he was, but we had never talked before. I loved his dreads, and asked if he would be up for letting me take his portrait when he picked up the print. He's actually lounging sideways in a chair for this photo. Its been interesting learning how to adapt situations to best suit a subject while still accomplishing the end goal and keeping the images consistent with the project. Thanks Collin!</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b0004af3-b6b9-4eb2-b7e7-87cbd5a178a5.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 6</h1><p>I admire John immensely. There are few people on this earth who selflessly care about others at the capacity that he does. He is in amazing leader, father, grandfather, mentor, and pastor, that always has a newfound energy and passion for every person he meets or talks with. Thanks for letting me photograph you!</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0b86e43a-ad16-4040-9e87-9e259e03246f.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Ive always thought it would be fun to shoot a portrait of her, framed by her own hair, and this project gave me the perfect reason to.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/101b02ba-4f7b-436e-a322-cfd1f754e1a4.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>52 Portraits, No. 2</h1><p>For my second portrait of this series, I thought my friend Lizzy would be great a subject. She had never been photographed in a studio situation before, so it was fun to direct her and work together to get an image we both really liked. We shot for about 15 minutes, and ended up with the image below that I really loved. Thanks Lizzy!</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b367ed83-15af-448e-b5d9-5e8eec05ea2d.jpg"></article>]]></description>
