  My friend Ty - coffee connoisseur, people lover, all around great guy. Ty is
  also an owner of 3030 Coffee (like Dan below). As I have observed him working
  over the past few years, I am always impressed by the respect, dignity, and
  positive attitude he shows every customer who walks in his store. Thanks for
  being part of the series man!
