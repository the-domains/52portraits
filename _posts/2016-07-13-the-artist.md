  Seth's passion for the visual story has led him to creating both still images
  and video for a variety of clients across the country. Be it a campaign for a
  fortune 50 company, a new startup, or local non profit, Seth invests himself
  completely in the project at hand. Combining both his ability to quickly
  connect with subjects, and beautiful lighting, Seth's images tell a story that
  immerse viewers. Having been raised in a family owned business, the values of
  hard work, good client relationships, and delivering on time and within budget
  have been drilled into him since an early age.

Outside of client work, he keeps himself busy with personal projects, and collaborating with friends in other creative fields. He is a cyclist, a bit of a coffee snob, and tries to spend a few nights of the year in a tent. He lives in Peoria, IL with his British wife, and their dog Winston.
