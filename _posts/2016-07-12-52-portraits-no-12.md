  John is the owner and biologist behind Alluvian, a skin care company that
  makes its products largely from ocean based ingredients like seaweed, salts,
  and other minerals. He is currently in the process of building a new site and
  asked me to do some photography for it - ranging from product/still life sets
  to some lifestyle and portrait scenes. I love working with people that believe
  in and are passionate about what they are doing, and John is no exception.
  After we got done shooting last week, I asked if he would mind lathering up in
  front of the camera with some of his shave cream for a portrait.
