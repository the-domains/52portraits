  Ben has been around since I first attempted to make a full time living at
  photography. We were roommates together in Denver, and I will never forget the
  adventures we had. Both of us moved out there on a whim without really knowing
  each other, and it is a season of my life that has really shaped me into who I
  am today, both creatively and personally. We have seen each other at our best
  and worse, been on awkward double dates together, and both tried out for Ninja
  warrior together... (seriously, scroll back through my facebook videos!)
