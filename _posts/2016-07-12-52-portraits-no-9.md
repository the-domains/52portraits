  Dan is a co owner of my favorite coffee shops, and over the past several years
  of going there on a near daily basis, we have become pretty good friends. Dan
  has always had a pretty cool beard or mustache combination, so I thought it
  would be fun to include him in the project. We shared a couple beers, chatted
  about our favorite taco places, and came out with this image.
