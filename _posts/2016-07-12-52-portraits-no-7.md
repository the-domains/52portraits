  I met Collin when he asked me if he could purchase a print from
  myWyomingseries. He plays in a relatively popular band from the area, so I
  knew who he was, but we had never talked before. I loved his dreads, and asked
  if he would be up for letting me take his portrait when he picked up the
  print. He's actually lounging sideways in a chair for this photo. Its been
  interesting learning how to adapt situations to best suit a subject while
  still accomplishing the end goal and keeping the images consistent with the
  project. Thanks Collin!
