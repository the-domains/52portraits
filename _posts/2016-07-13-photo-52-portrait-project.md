  A few years ago I did a photo 365 project, and was really amazed at how much I
  grew through the project, as well as how much fun I had. I love shooting
  portraits, but most of my work and personal projects have always been location
  assignments where I am lighting people in natural backgrounds. As much fun as
  those are, I want to push myself to shoot more portraits in the studio on a
  background. Its a different way and challenge to capturing someone and tell a
  story. For the rest of the year I'll be shooting a black and white portrait of
  someone every week, and sharing on my Grid site and instagram.
