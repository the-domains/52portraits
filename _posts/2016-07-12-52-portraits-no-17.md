  Iâ€™ve added a new assistant to the SLP team, and thought I would intro him via
  the 52 Portraits project... Everyone, meet Jack! He is headed to film school
  in the fall, but will be working with me in the mean time. He's been a huge
  help so far, and its nice having another trust worth set of hands around when
  things get hectic.
