  My Uncle Ned is this weeks subject for the 52 Portraits project. We spent a
  lot of family get togethers jamming in his basement on one of the coolest
  guitar collections you could imagine. A couple of years ago he was diagnosed
  with Parkinson’s Disease. Instead of letting it define his future in a
  negative way, he has decided to use it as a tool to both strengthen others
  with Parkinson's, and educate people on the topic. A series of events led him
  to join a program called Rock Steady Boxing, where boxing is used a tool to
  literally fight back against Parkinson’s. You can read more about the boxing
  program, and my Uncle’s storyhere.
