  Seeing as today is Mother's Day, I had to include my mom in this project. She
  has supported me through every crazy idea I have had... from my long haired,
  punk rock guitar days, to dropping out of college to travel across the
  country, to starting my own business and getting married, she has been
  believed in me the whole time. Thanks mom! Much love, and I wouldn't be who I
  am without you.
