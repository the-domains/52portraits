  Mike has become such a good friend and mentor to me over the past couple of
  years, so I knew I needed to photograph him for this project. I don't think I
  know anyone who can simultaneously work so hard while also leading an awesome
  family the way that he does. If man cards were a real thing, your face would
  probably be on them Mike.
