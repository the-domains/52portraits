  For my second portrait of this series, I thought my friend Lizzy would be
  great a subject. She had never been photographed in a studio situation before,
  so it was fun to direct her and work together to get an image we both really
  liked. We shot for about 15 minutes, and ended up with the image below that I
  really loved. Thanks Lizzy!
